# Normalifier
A tera-proxy module that blocks specific abnormals in order to not trigger annoying screen effects on your client (e.g. Lein's Dark Root Beer).  
This is a fork of spaacecats' original no-drunk-screen.  

## Usage
The module is enabled by default and will block annoying screen effects.  
  
* **norm** - enable/disable Normalifier
